# YelpCamp

#### YelpCamp is a website that mimics Yelp for campsite locations. You are able to create an account to create and edit your own campsite entries. In addition to generating locations, you are able to leave reviews on entries of other users. This was created following along with Colt Steele's Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp.
